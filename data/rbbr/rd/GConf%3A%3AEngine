= class GConf::Engine
A GConf::Engine represents a connection to a GConf database.  The default GConf::Engine, returned by a call to GConf::Engine.new with no arguments, represents the current users own GConf database.  A GConf::Engine should be used in conjunction with a GConf::Client, as it has no methods of its own.
