= module Gst
The GStreamer module.

== Module Functions
--- Gst.has_threads?
    This method returns true if GStreamer has threads enabled, false otherwise.
    * Returns: true if GStreamer has threads enabled, false otherwise.

--- Gst.init(*args)
    Initializes the GStreamer library (using *args), setting up internal path 
    lists, registering built-in elements, and loading standard plugins.
    If *args are ommited, GStreamer will be initialized using arguments from the 
    Ruby command line.
    A RuntimeError exception will be raised if GStreamer could not be initialized.
    * Returns: always true, or an exception on failure.

--- Gst.set_debug(state)
    Enables or disable debug mode, according to the provided parameter.
    When debug mode is on, Ruby/GStreamer will print various information
    on the screen (as instance, when the GC cames), useful to trace and fix bugs.
    * state: a boolean state.  
    * Returns: always nil.

--- Gst.use_threads(state)
    Instructs the core to turn on/off threading. 
    When threading is turned off, all thread operations such as 
    mutexes and conditionals are turned into NOPs. 
    Use this if you want absolute minimal overhead and you don't 
    use any threads in the pipeline.
    * state: a boolean state.  
    * Returns: the provided boolean value.

--- Gst.version
    Gets the version number of the GStreamer library, in an array
    of 3 fixnums, which represent major, minor and macro numbers. 
    	# Prints GStreamer version in a String 'major.minor.macro'
    	p Gst.version.join('.')
    * Returns: an Array of 3 fixnums (major, minor and macro numbers).

== Constants
--- MSECOND
    Constant that defines one GStreamer millisecond.

--- NSECOND
    Constant that defines one GStreamer nanosecond.

--- SECOND
    Constant that defines one GStreamer second.

--- USECOND
    Constant that defines one GStreamer microsecond.

--- VERSION_MAJOR
    GStreamer's major version.

--- VERSION_MICRO
    GStreamer's micro version.

--- VERSION_MINOR
    GStreamer's minor version.
