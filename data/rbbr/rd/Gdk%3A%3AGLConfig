Frame Buffer Configuration - OpenGL frame buffer configuration object

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gdk::GLConfig

== Class Methods
--- Gdk::GLConfig.new([screen,] attrib_list/mode)
    Returns an OpenGL frame buffer configuration that matches the specified configuration.
    * screen: optional, if specified indicates the target Gdk::Screen.
        * You can simply ignore it as on most computers it is not needed.
        * You cannot give any screen if Gdk::GL::MULTIHEAD_SUPPORT is false and you must give one if Gdk::GL::MULTIHEAD_SAFE is true.
    * attrib_list/mode: you can give either:
        * attrib_list: array of attribute/value pairs.
        * mode: display mode bit mask.
    * Returns: the new Gdk::GLConfig

== Instance Methods
--- colormap
    Gets the Gdk::Colormap that is appropriate for the OpenGL frame buffer configuration.
    * Returns: the appropriate Gdk::Colormap.

--- depth
    Gets the color depth of the OpenGL-capable visual.
    * Returns: number of bits per pixel

--- double_buffered?
    Returns whether the configuration supports the double-buffered visual.
    * Returns: true if the double-buffered visual is supported, false otherwise.
    
--- get_attrib(attribute)
    Gets information about the OpenGL frame buffer configuration.
    * attribute: the attribute to be returned.
    * Returns: the requested value or nil if the value could not be found.
    
--- has_accum_buffer?
    Returns whether the configured frame buffer has accumulation buffer.
    * Returns: true if the frame buffer has accumulation buffer, false otherwise.
    
--- has_alpha?
    Returns whether the configured color buffer has alpha bits.
    * Returns: true if the color buffer has alpha bits, false otherwise.
    
--- has_depth_buffer?
    Returns whether the configured frame buffer has depth buffer.
    * Returns: true if the frame buffer has depth buffer, false otherwise
    
--- has_stencil_buffer?
    Returns whether the configured frame buffer has stencil buffer.
    * Returns: true if the frame buffer has stencil buffer, false otherwise
    
--- layer_plane
    Gets the layer plane (level) of the frame buffer. Zero is the default frame buffer. Positive layer planes correspond to frame buffers that overlay the default buffer, and negative layer planes correspond to frame buffers that underlie the default frame buffer.
    * Returns: layer plane.
    
--- n_aux_buffers
    Gets the number of auxiliary color buffers.
    * Returns: number of auxiliary color buffers.
    
--- n_sample_buffers
    Gets the number of multisample buffers.
    * Returns: number of multisample buffers.
    
--- rgba?
    Returns whether the configured frame buffer is RGBA mode.
    * Returns: true if the configured frame buffer is RGBA mode, false otherwise.

--- screen
    Gets the Gdk::Screen.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Screen

--- stereo?
    Returns whether the configuration supports the stereo visual.
    * Returns: true if the stereo visual is supported, false otherwise.
    
--- visual
    Gets the Gdk::Visual that is appropriate for the OpenGL frame buffer configuration.
    * Returns: the appropriate Gdk::Visual.
