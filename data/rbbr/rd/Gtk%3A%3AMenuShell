= class Gtk::MenuShell
A Gtk::MenuShell is the abstract base class used to derive the Gtk::Menu and Gtk::MenuBar subclasses.

A Gtk::MenuShell is a container of Gtk::MenuItem objects arranged in a list which can be navigated, selected, and activated by the user to perform application functions. A Gtk::MenuItem can have a submenu associated with it, allowing for nested hierarchical menus.
