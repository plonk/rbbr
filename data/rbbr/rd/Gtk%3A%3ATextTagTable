= class Gtk::TextTagTable
A Gtk::TextTagTable defines a set of tags that can be used together. Each Gtk::TextBuffer has one tag table associated with it; only tags from that tag table can be used with the buffer. A single tag table can be shared between multiple buffers, however.

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::TextTagTable.new
    Creates a new Gtk::TextTagTable. The table contains no tags by default.
    * Returns : a new Gtk::TextTagTable

== Instance Methods
--- add(tag)
    Add a tag to the table. The tag is assigned the highest priority in the table.
    tag must not be in a tag table already, and may not have the same name as an already-added tag.
    * tag: a Gtk::TextTag
    * Returns: self

--- each {|tag| ... }
    Calls block on each tag in table.
    * tag: a Gtk::TextTag
    * Returns: self

--- lookup(name)

    * name:  name of a tag 
    * Returns: Gtk::TextTag, or nil if none by that name is in the table.

--- remove(tag)

--- size
    Returns the size of the table (number of tags)
    * Returns: the size of the table
