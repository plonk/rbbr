== Instance Methods
--- append_row(*values)
    Their length must match model's
    column count.
    Appends a row to the data model.
    * values: a list of Gda::Value objects. 
    * Returns: the added row, as a Gda::Row object, on success, nil on errors.

--- begin_edit
    Starts update of this data model. This method should be the
    first called when modifying the data model.
    * Returns: true on success, false if there was an error.

--- cancel_edit
    Cancels update of this data model. This means that all changes
    will be discarded, and the old data put back in the model.
    * Returns: true on success, false if there was an error.

--- columns
    This method returns a list of all column titles in the model, as an Array of strings.
    * Returns: a list of all column titles in the model, as an Array of strings.

--- command_text
    Gets the text of command that generated this data model.
    * Returns: a string with the command issued.

--- command_text=(text)
    Sets the command text of this data model.
    * text: the command text.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'text'.

--- command_type
    This method returns the command type of this data model (see ((<GdaCommandType|Gda::Command#GdaCommandType>))).
    * Returns: the command type of this data model (see ((<GdaCommandType|Gda::Command#GdaCommandType>))).

--- command_type=(type)
    Sets the command type of this data model.
    * type: the command type (see ((<GdaCommandType|Gda::Command#GdaCommandType>))).  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'type'.

--- describe_column(colnum)
    Queries the underlying data model implementation for a description of a
    given column. That description is returned in the form of a 
    Gda::FieldAttributes object, which contains all the information about the
    given column in the data model.
    * colnum: a column number.  
    * Returns: the description of the column, as a Gda::FieldAttributes object.

--- each_column { |col_title| ... }
    Calls the block for each column title in the model, passing a reference
    to a String object as parameter.
    * Returns: always nil.

--- each_row { |row| ... }
    Calls the block for each row in the data model, passing a reference to a
    Gda::Row object as parameter.
    * Returns: always nil.

--- editable?
    This method returns true if the model can be updated, false otherwise.
    * Returns: true if the model can be updated, false otherwise.

--- editing?
    Checks whether this data model is in updating mode or not. Updating
    mode is set to true when Gda::DataModel#begin_edit has been
    called successfully, and is not set back to false until either
    Gda::DataModel#cancel_edit or Gda::DataModel#end_edit have been called.
    * Returns: true if updating mode, false otherwise.

--- emit_changed
    Notifies listeners of the given data model object of changes in the
    underlying data. Listeners usually will connect themselves to the "changed"
    signal in the Gda::DataModel class, thus being notified of any new data
    being appended or removed from the data model.
    * Returns: self.

--- emit_row_inserted(rownum)
    Emits the 'row_inserted' and 'changed' signals on the model.
    * rownum: a row number.  
    * Returns: self.

--- emit_row_removed(rownum)
    Emits the 'row_removed' and 'changed' signals on the model.
    * rownum: a row number.  
    * Returns: self.

--- emit_row_updated(rownum)
    Emits the 'row_updated' and 'changed' signals on the model.
    * rownum: a row number.  
    * Returns: self.

--- end_edit
    Approves all modifications and send them to the underlying
    data source/store.
    * Returns: true on success, false if there was an error.

--- freeze!
    Disables notifications of changes on the data model. To re-enable
    notifications again, you should call the Gda::DataModel#thaw method.
    * Returns: self.

--- get_column_pos(col_title)
    Gets the position of a column on the data model, based on the column's title.
    * col_title: a column title.  
    * Returns: the position of the column in the data model, or -1 if the column could not be found.

--- get_column_title(colnum)
    This method returns the title for the given column in the model.
    * colnum: a column number.  
    * Returns: the title for the given column in the model.

--- get_row(rownum)
    Retrieves a given row from the data model.
    * rownum: a row number.  
    * Returns: the row, as a Gda::Row object, or nil if the given row number is invalid.

--- n_columns
    This method returns the number of columns in the model.
    * Returns: the number of columns in the model.

--- n_rows
    This method returns the number of rows in the data model.
    * Returns: the number of rows in the data model.

--- remove_row(row)
    Removes a row from the data model. This results in the underlying database
    row being removed in the database.
    * row: a Gda::Row object.  
    * Returns: true if successful, false otherwise.

--- rows
    This method returns a list of all the rows in the data model, as an Array of Gda::Row objects.
    * Returns: a list of all the rows in the data model, as an Array of Gda::Row objects.

--- set_command_text(text)
    Sets the command text of this data model.
    * text: the command text.  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_command_type(type)
    Sets the command type of this data model.
    * type: the command type (see ((<GdaCommandType|Gda::Command#GdaCommandType>))).  
    * Returns: self.

--- thaw!
    Re-enables notifications of changes on the given data model.
    * Returns: self.

--- to_comma_separated
    Converts the given model into a comma-separated series of rows.
    * Returns: the string representation of the model.

--- to_tab_separated
    Converts the given model into a tab-separated series of rows.
    * Returns: the string representation of the model.

--- to_xml(standalone=false)
    Converts the given model into a XML representation.
    * Returns: the string representation of the model.

--- update_row(row)
    Updates a row data model. This results in the underlying database row's
    values being changed.
    * row: a Gda::Row object.  
    * Returns: true if successful, false otherwise.
