= class Gtk::FontSelection
The Gtk::FontSelection widget lists the available fonts, styles and sizes, allowing the user to select a font. It is used in the Gtk::FontSelectionDialog widget to provide a dialog box for selecting fonts. 
To set the font which is initially selected, use Gtk::FontSelection#font_name=. 
To get the selected font use Gtk::FontSelection#font_name. 
To change the text which is shown in the preview area, use Gtk::FontSelection#preview_text=. 

Filters can be used to limit the fonts shown. There are 2 filters in the Gtk::FontSelection - a base filter and a user filter. The base filter can not be changed by the user, so this can be used when the user must choose from the restricted set of fonts (e.g. for a terminal-type application you may want to force the user to select a fixed-width font). The user filter can be changed or reset by the user, by using the 'Reset Filter' button or changing the options on the 'Filter' page of the widget.
