== Instance Methods
--- ==(clock)
    This method returns true if two Gst::Clock objects are synchronized on the same time, false otherwise.
    * clock: a Gst::Clock object.  
    * Returns: true if two Gst::Clock objects are synchronized on the same time, false otherwise.

--- active=(state)
    Activates or deactivates the clock based on the active parameter. 
    As soon as the clock is activated, the time will start ticking.
    * state: a boolean value.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'state'.

--- active?
    This method returns true if the clock is active, false otherwise.
    * Returns: true if the clock is active, false otherwise.

--- handle_discont(time)
    Notifies the clock of a discontinuity in time (nanoseconds).
    It is possible that the clock was not updated by this call because only 
    the first discontinuitity in the pipeline is honoured.
    * time: time in nanoseconds.  
    * Returns: true if the clock was updated, otherwise false.

--- reset!
    Reset the clock to time 0.
    * Returns: self.

--- resolution
    This method returns the accuracy of the clock.
    * Returns: the accuracy of the clock.

--- resolution=(resolution)
    Sets the accuracy of the clock.
    * resolution: the accurary of the clock.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'resolution'.

--- set_active(state)
    Activates or deactivates the clock based on the active parameter. 
    As soon as the clock is activated, the time will start ticking.
    * state: a boolean value.  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_resolution(resolution)
    Sets the accuracy of the clock.
    * resolution: the accurary of the clock.  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_speed(speed)
    Sets the speed of the clock.
    1.0 is the default speed.
    * speed: the speed of the clock.  
    * Returns: self.

--- speed
    This method returns the speed of the clock.
    * Returns: the speed of the clock.

--- speed=(speed)
    Sets the speed of the clock.
    1.0 is the default speed.
    * speed: the speed of the clock.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'speed'.

--- time
    This method returns the time of the clock (in nanoseconds).
    * Returns: the time of the clock (in nanoseconds).
