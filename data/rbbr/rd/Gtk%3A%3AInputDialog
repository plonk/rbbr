= class Gtk::InputDialog
((*NOTE*)) this widget is considered too specialized/little-used for GTK+, and will in the future be moved to some other package. If your application needs this widget, feel free to use it, as the widget does work and is useful in some applications; it's just not of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features for the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+ distribution.

Gtk::InputDialog displays a dialog which allows the user to configure XInput extension devices. For each device, they can control the mode of the device (disabled, screen-relative, or window-relative), the mapping of axes to coordinates, and the mapping of the devices macro keys to key press events.

Gtk::InputDialog contains two buttons to which the application can connect; one for closing the dialog, and one for saving the changes. No actions are bound to these by default. The changes that the user makes take effect immediately.
