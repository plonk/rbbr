== Class Methods
--- Gda::Export.new(conn)
    Creates a new Gda::Export object, which allows you to easily add exporting
    functionality to your programs.
    It works by first having a Gda::Connection object associated to it, and then
    allowing you to retrieve information about all the objects present in the
    database, and also to add/remove those objects from a list of selected
    objects.
    When you're done, you just run the export (Gda::Export#run), first
    connecting to the different signals that will let you be informed of the
    export process progress.
    * conn: a Gda::Connection object.  
    * Returns: a newly created Gda::Export object.

== Instance Methods
--- connection
    This method returns the Gda::Connection object associated with the export object.
    * Returns: the Gda::Connection object associated with the export object.

--- connection=(conn)
    Associates the given Gda::Connection object with the export object.
    * conn: a Gda::Connection object.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'conn'.

--- run(flags=Gda::Export::FLAGS_TABLE_DATA)
    Starts the execution of the given export object. This means that, after
    calling this method, your application will lose control about the
    export process and will only receive notifications via the class signals.
    * flags: executing flags (see ((<GdaExportFlags|Gda::Export#GdaExportFlags>))).  
    * Returns: self.

--- select_tables(*names)
    Adds all the given tables to the list of selected tables.
    * names: list of table names to be selected.  
    * Returns: self.

--- selected_tables
    Returns a list with the names of all the currently selected objects in the
    Gda::Export object.
    * Returns: an Array containing the names of the selected tables.

--- set_connection(conn)
    Associates the given Gda::Connection object with the export object.
    * conn: a Gda::Connection object.  
    * Returns: self.

--- stop
    Stops execution of the export object.
    * Returns: self.

--- tables
    Returns a list of all tables that exist in the Gda::Connection being used by
    the Gda::Export object. This method is useful when you're building, for
    example, a list for the user to select which tables he/she wants in the
    export process.
    * Returns: an Array containing the name of all the tables.

--- unselect_tables(*names)
    Removes the given table names from the list of selected tables.
    * names: list of table names to be unselected.  
    * Returns: self.
