= class GConf::MetaInfo
The class GConf::MetaInfo holds metainformation about a key, such as last modification time and the name of the associated schema.  Though this may sound nice, the current GConf API does not allow for the actual retrieval of this information, and so this is only included for consistency with the C version of the GConf API.
