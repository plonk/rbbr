= class Gdk::Atom
Gdk::Atom is an opaque type representing a string as an index into a table of strings on the X server

Each window under X can have any number of associated properties attached to it. Properties are arbitrary chunks of data identified by atoms. (An atom is a numeric index into a string table on the X server. They are used to transfer strings efficiently between clients without having to transfer the entire string.) A property has an associated type, which is also identified using an atom.

== Class Methods
--- Gdk::Atom.new(atom)
    Creates a new Gdk::Atom.
    * atom: an Atom value(Integer)
    * Returns: a new Gdk::Atom

--- Gdk::Atom.intern(atom_name, only_if_exists)
    Finds or creates an atom corresponding to a given string.
    * atom_name: a string. 
    * only_if_exists: if true, do not create a new atom, but just return the atom if it already exists. 
    * Returns: the atom corresponding to atom_name, or, if only_if_exists is true, and an atom does not already exists for the string, Gdk::Atom::NONE. 
    * Returns: self

    Checks if two atoms are equal. 
    * Returns: true if two atoms are equal.

--- name
    Determines the string corresponding to an atom.
    * Returns: a string corresponding to atom. 

--- to_i
