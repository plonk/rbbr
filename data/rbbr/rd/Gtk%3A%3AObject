= class Gtk::Object
Gtk::Object is the base class for all widgets, and for a few non-widget objects such as Gtk::Adjustment. Gtk::Object predates GLib::Object; non-widgets that derive from Gtk::Object rather than GLib::Object do so for backward compatibility reasons. 

In Ruby/GTK, one of the difference between Gtk::Object and GLib::Object is the "destroy" signal, emitted by the Gtk::Object#destroy method. The "destroy" signal asks all code owning a reference to an object to release said reference. So, for example, if you call Gtk::Object#destroy on a Gtk::Window, Ruby/GTK will release it; if you call Gtk::Object#destroy on a Gtk::Button, then the button will be removed from its parent container and the parent container will release its reference to the button.

== Instance Methods
--- destroy
    Emits the "destroy" signal notifying all reference holders that they should release the Gtk::Object.
--- flags
    Gets the ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>)) for an object without directly accessing its members. 
    * Returns: the object whose flags are returned(((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>))).  
--- flags=(flags)
    Sets the ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>)) for an object without directly accessing its members. 
    * flags: ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>))
    * Returns: flags
--- set_flags(flags)
    Same as flags=.
    * flags: ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>))
    * Returns: self

--- unset_flags(flags)
    Unsets the ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>)) for an object without directly accessing.
    * flags: ((<GtkObjectFlags|Gtk::Object#GtkObjectFlags>))
    * Returns: self

== Constants
=== GtkObjectFlags
--- FLOATING
    the object is orphaned. 
--- IN_DESTRUCTION
    the object is currently being destroyed. This is used internally by GTK+ to prevent reinvokations during destruction. 
--- RESERVED_1
    reserved for future use 
--- RESERVED_2
    reserved for future use 

== Properties
--- user-data: GLib::Pointer (Read/Write)
    Anonymous User Data Pointer

== Signals
--- destroy: self
     * self: Gtk::Object
