= module GLib

== Module Functions
--- GLib.charset
    Obtains the character set for the current locale; you might use this character set as an argument to GLib.convert, to convert from the current locale's encoding to some other encoding. (Frequently GLib.locale_to_utf8 and GLib.locale_from_utf8 are nice shortcuts, though.) 
    * Returns: the character set name 

--- GLib.convert(str, to_codeset, from_codeset)
    Converts a string from one character set to another. 
    If the conversion is not successful, it causes RuntimeError.
    * str: the string to convert  
    * to_codeset : name of character set into which to convert str  
    * from_codeset : character set of str.  
    * Returns: a newly string

--- GLib.locale_from_utf8(str)
    Converts a string from UTF-8 to the encoding used for strings by the C runtime (usually the same as that used by the operating system) in the current locale. If the conversion is not successful, it causes RuntimeError.
    * str: a UTF-8 encoded string  
    * Returns: the converted string

--- GLib.locale_to_utf8(str)
    Converts a string which is in the encoding used for strings by the C runtime (usually the same as that used by the operating system) in the current locale into a UTF-8 string. If the conversion is not successful, it causes RuntimeError.
    * str: a string in the encoding of the current locale  
    * Returns: the converted string 

--- GLib.filename_from_utf8(str)
    Converts a string from UTF-8 to the encoding used for filenames.
    * str: a UTF-8 encoded string  
    * Returns: the converted string

--- GLib.filename_to_utf8(str)
    Converts a string which is in the encoding used for filenames into a UTF-8 string. If the conversion is not successful, it causes RuntimeError.
    * str: a string in the encoding for filenames
    * Returns: the converted string 

--- GLib.filename_from_uri(uri)
    Converts an escaped UTF-8 encoded URI to a local filename in the encoding used for filenames. If the conversion is not successful, it causes RuntimeError.
    * uri: a uri describing a filename (escaped, encoded in UTF-8)
    * Returns: the resulting filename

--- GLib.filename_to_uri(filename, hostname = nil)
    Converts an absolute filename to an escaped UTF-8 encoded URI.
    * filename: an absolute filename specified in the encoding used for filenames by the operating system.  
    * hostname: a UTF-8 encoded hostname, or nil for none.  
    * Returns: the resulting URI
