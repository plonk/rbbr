Management of transactions.

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gda::Transaction

== Class Methods
--- Gda::Transaction.new(name)
    Creates a new Gda::Transaction object, which allows a fine-tune and full
    control of transactions to be used with providers.
    * name: name for the transaction.  
    * Returns: a newly created Gda::Transaction object.

== Instance Methods
--- isolation_level
    Gets the isolation level (see ((<GdaTransactionIsolation|Gda::Transaction#GdaTransactionIsolation>))) for the
    transaction. This specifies the locking behavior for the database connection
    during the given transaction.
    * Returns: the isolation level.

--- isolation_level=(level)
    Sets the isolation level of the transaction.
    * level: the isolation level (see ((<GdaTransactionIsolation|Gda::Transaction#GdaTransactionIsolation>))).  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'level'.

--- name
    Retrieves the name of the transaction, as specified by the client
    application (via a non-nil parameter in the call to Gda::Transaction.new, 
    or by calling Gda::Transaction#set_name).
    Note that some providers may set, when you call
    Gda::Connection#begin_transaction, the name of the transaction if it's not
    been specified by the client application, so this method may return, for
    some providers, values that you don't expect.
    * Returns: the name of the transaction.

--- name=(name)
    Sets the name of the transaction. This is very useful when using providers
    that support named transactions.
    * name: a new name for the transaction.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'name'.

--- set_isolation_level(level)
    Sets the isolation level of the transaction.
    * level: the isolation level (see ((<GdaTransactionIsolation|Gda::Transaction#GdaTransactionIsolation>))).  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_name(name)
    Sets the name of the transaction. This is very useful when using providers
    that support named transactions.
    * name: a new name for the transaction.  
    * Returns: self.
