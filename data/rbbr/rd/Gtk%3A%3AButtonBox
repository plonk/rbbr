= class Gtk::ButtonBox
The primary purpose of this class is to keep track of the various properties of Gtk::HButtonBox and Gtk::VButtonBox widgets. 

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gtk::Object
        * Gtk::Widget
          * Gtk::Container
            * Gtk::Box
              * Gtk::ButtonBox

== Instance Methods
--- layout_style
    Retrieves the method being used to arrange the buttons in a button box. 
    * Returns: ((<GtkButtonBoxStyle|Gtk::ButtonBox#GtkButtonBoxStyle>)). the method used to layout buttons in widget. 
    
--- layout_style=(style)
    Changes the way buttons are arranged in their container. 
    * style: ((<GtkButtonBoxStyle|Gtk::ButtonBox#GtkButtonBoxStyle>)). the new layout style.  
    * Returns: style
    
--- set_layout_style(style)
    Same as layout_style=.
    * layout_style : the new layout style.  
    * Returns: self
    
--- set_child_secondary(child, is_secondary)
    Sets whether child should appear in a secondary group of children. A typical use of a secondary child is the help button in a dialog. 
    This group appears after the other children if the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::START, Gtk::ButtonBox::SPREAD or Gtk::ButtonBox::EDGE, and before the the other children if the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::END. 
    For horizontal button boxes, the definition of before/after depends on direction of the widget (see Gtk::Widget#set_direction). If the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::START or Gtk::ButtonBox::END, then the secondary children are aligned at the other end of the button box from the main children. For the other styles, they appear immediately next to the main children.
     *child: a child of widget  
     *is_secondary : if true, the child appears in a secondary group of the button box.
     * Returns: self
