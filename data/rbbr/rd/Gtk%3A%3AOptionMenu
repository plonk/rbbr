= class Gtk::OptionMenu
A Gtk::OptionMenu is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of valid choices. The Gtk::OptionMenu displays the selected choice. When activated the Gtk::OptionMenu displays a popup Gtk::Menu which allows the user to make a new choice.

Using a Gtk::OptionMenu is simple; build a Gtk::Menu, by calling Gtk::Menu.new, then appending menu items to it with Gtk::MenuShell#append. Set that menu on the option menu with Gtk::OptionMenu#menu=. Set the selected menu item with Gtk::OptionMenu#history=; connect to the "changed" signal on the option menu; in the "changed" signal, check the new selected menu item with Gtk::OptionMenu#history.
